I have provided the .html and the .Rmd files. You can copy them into your computer and see them via RStudio and/or browser.
If you stil canÂ´t see the .html displayed, load the file directly from the .html code provided you need to download it 
and use a service like Githack. ("https://raw.githack.com/") I have done it and provided the following link.

Information on Githack:

Just copy the ".html" link of the file provided by Github into the first entry point provided.
As soon as you do it, and as long as it is a valid Github link, two links will pop up.
One is production and the other development. Now you can either use one or these two links. Copy one into you normal browser 
and you will see the correct display of the file.

Information provided by Githack:

"When you request a file from source control hosting services, they are usually served (in the case of JavaScript,
HTML, CSS, and some other file types) with a Content-Type of text/plain. As a result, most modern browsers won't actually 
interpret it as JavaScript, HTML, or CSS.

They do this because serving raw files from a git repo is relatively inefficient, so they want to discourage people from 
using their repos for static file hosting.

raw.githack.com acts as a caching proxy, forwarding requests to the corresponding service, caching the responses either 
for a short time (in the case of development URLs) or permanently (in the case of CDN URLs), and relaying them to your 
browser with the correct Content-Type headers.

The caching layer ensures that minimal load is placed on each service, and you get quick and easy static file hosting 
right from a repo. Everyone's happy!"
